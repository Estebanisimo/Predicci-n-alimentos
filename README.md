Data Science Project: Food Price Prediction

This project analyzes food prices in Barcelona over a three-year period. The data is collected from a variety of sources, including the Barcelona City Council and Mercabarna. The prices of electricity, fuel, temperature, and precipitation are also included in the analysis.

The project consists of three main parts:

    Data collection and cleaning: The data is collected from the Barcelona City Council and Mercabarna and cleaned to ensure that it is accurate and consistent.
    Data analysis: The data is analyzed to identify trends and correlations.
    Modeling: Three models are trained to predict food prices: K-nearest neighbors, linear regression, and random forest.

The results of the project show that there is a strong relationship between food prices and the price of electricity, fuel, temperature, and precipitation. The K-nearest neighbors model was the most accurate model for predicting food prices.
Data Sources

The data for this project was collected from the following sources:

    Barcelona City Council: The Barcelona City Council provides data on food prices from Mercabarna, the main wholesale market in Barcelona.
    Mercabarna: Mercabarna provides data on food prices from its vendors.

Data Cleaning

The data was cleaned to ensure that it was accurate and consistent. The following steps were taken to clean the data:

    Missing values: Missing values were filled in using the mean or median value for the corresponding column.
    Outliers: Outliers were identified and removed.
    Data types: The data types of the columns were checked and corrected as needed.

Data Analysis

The data was analyzed to identify trends and correlations. The following methods were used to analyze the data:

    Time series analysis: Time series analysis was used to identify trends in the food prices.
    Correlation analysis: Correlation analysis was used to identify correlations between the food prices and other variables.

Modeling

Three models were trained to predict food prices:

    K-nearest neighbors: The K-nearest neighbors model predicts the price of a food item based on the prices of similar food items.
    Linear regression: The linear regression model predicts the price of a food item based on a linear relationship between the price and other variables.
    Random forest: The random forest model predicts the price of a food item based on a combination of decision trees.

Results

The results of the project show that there is a strong relationship between food prices and the price of electricity, fuel, temperature, and precipitation. The K-nearest neighbors model was the most accurate model for predicting food prices.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data science to analyze food prices. The results of the project can be used to help businesses and individuals make informed decisions about food prices.
